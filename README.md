You can create a bookmarks viewer in Obsidian with the [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) Theme, [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin, and this note:

```markdown
---
cssclasses:
  - cards
  - cards-cover
  - cards-2-3
  - cards-cols-4
  - max
---

\`\`\`dataview
TABLE 
	WITHOUT id ("![](" + Cover + ")") AS Cover,
	("[" + Title + "](" + Link + ")") AS Title,
	Date,
	Tags[0] + ", " + Tags[1] + ", " + Tags[2]  AS Tags,
	("[[" + file.path + "| Edit ]]") AS Edit
FROM "Bookmarks"
SORT Title ASC
\`\`\`
```
(remove the backslashes before the triple backticks to use the code block)
